# Maillage et Éléments Finis

## Requierement

This lecture note (in french, sorry), has been created using Python Sphinx Documentation, the Furo theme and Sphinx-Proof extension. You need to install the three of them to make it work

```bash
pip install -U sphinx
pip install -U furo
pip install -U sphinxcontrib-proof
```

And then compile type `make html` to build the html folder (in `_build/html`) and/or `make latex` and `make latexpdf` to build the pdf of the lecture note.

A `.gitlab-ci.yml` file is also available to use it with Gitlab Page.
